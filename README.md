# Hi, I'm Gabby!
I am a lab manager for the Michigan Neurogenetics and Developmental Psychopathology (MiND) Lab, directed by Dr. Luke Hyde, and the Translational and Developmental Neuroscience (TaD) Lab, directed by Dr. Christopher Monk. I'm also a research assistant for the Self-Regulation, Early Experience, and Development (SEED) Lab, directed by Dr. Jamie Lawler, and a producer for the brainSTEM podcast, hosted by Dr. Hilary Marusak. I hope to further develop my skills and professional network and to eventually pursue a PhD in clinical psychology. Let's connect!
