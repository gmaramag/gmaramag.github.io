# Hi, I'm Gabby!
I am going to be a lab manager for the Michigan Neurogenetics and Developmental Psychopathology (MiND) lab, directed by Dr. Luke Hyde, and the Translational and Developmental Neuroscience (TaD) lab, directed by Dr. Christopher Monk. I hope to further develop my skills and professional network and to eventually pursue a PhD in clinical psychology.
