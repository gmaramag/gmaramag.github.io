# Hi, I'm Gabby!
I am going to be a lab manager for the Michigan Neurogenetics and Developmental Psychopathology (MiND) lab, directed by Dr. Luke Hyde, and the Translational and Developmental Neuroscience (TaD) lab, directed by Christopher Monk, at the University of Michigan. I am looking to further develop my skills and professional network and to eventually pursue a PhD in clinical psychology.
